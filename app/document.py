"""
Document Management Module
This module handles document state and coordinates CRDT operations.

TODO: Implement the following:

1. Document class:
   - __init__(self)
   - apply_operation(self, operation: dict, client_id: str)
   - get_state(self) -> dict
   - reset(self)
   - _broadcast_operation(self, operation: dict, exclude_client: str = None)

2. Operation handling:
   - Validate incoming operations
   - Apply operations to CRDT
   - Broadcast to other clients
   - Handle operation ordering
